# Unit 1: Pandas & Simple Linear Regression

**In this first unit of the course, students are going to go through the data process for the first time**. The main technologies they will work with during unit 1 are Excel, SQL, and Python. The students will apply their newly acquired knowledge to solve problems in the sales industry and to promote donations for an NGO.

**The aim of this unit is to set the fundamentals of Data Analysis:** How to ask questions, how to interpret questions, where does the data come from and why it might be valid/invalid, How did I process that data and why it might be valid (articulate),Â how did I validate the model I built and why did I choose it over others (notions of _"what does good look like"_), what do the results mean, what is the business relevance of this analysis.

### By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. Gather data from different .csv files
2. Apply basic operations to existing data sources: merging files, concatenate files, querying the database, retrieving data.
3. Clean existing data: spot outliers, fix null values, typos, duplicates and data types (both numerical and categorical).
   - Interpret when to use mean vs. median to clean data.
4. Apply basic operations to data structure, such as: group by, distributions and transformations.
5. Perform basic exploratory data analysis using linear regression models
   - Interpret notions of correlation, distribution, accuracy in order to choose a model and manipulate the data
6. Process various kinds of data - numerical and categorical -
   - Apply basic operations: normalization, min/max, standardization, transformation, formatting
7. Implement Feature engineering (selection) to solve business problems
8. Build linear regression models to interpret data
   - Split into training and test sets.
   - Feed model to train the data.
   - Test accuracy of model.
9. Validate your model using Cross validation, Parameterization and Running the test data.
   - Use Data Viz to answer business questions. (analysis)
10. Report and present your work professionally
    - Use Data Viz tools to Plot histograms and box plot.
    - Build engaging presentations applying storytelling, business Framing, with the intention to get buy-in from stakeholders
    - Use adequate vocabulary depending on the audience your are targeting.
