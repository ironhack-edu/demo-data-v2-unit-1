### Lesson 1 key concepts

[Refer to the deck: 1.1.3 Intro to Data Analytics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17tMGD3qdobOqp2T3Owk9APN8C-_VXDqoNKWKCfxXINE/edit?usp=sharing)

> :clock10: 20 min

- Introduction to data analysis and the kinds of business problems we can solve (see appendix 1.1)
- Skillset - Technical knowledge and sharp business acumen
- Differences in the roles of data engineers, data analysts, and data scientists
- Tools and technologies available (see appendix 1.2) - quick 5 min highlight - the idea is only to familiarize with the names
  - Languages - Python, SQL, R, Scala, Java
  - Development tools - Integrated Development Environments or IDEs (Pycharm, R Studio, VS Code), web-based notebooks (Jupyter, Google Colab), Version Control Systems (Git)
  - Database Management Systems: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle...
  - Data platform and ingestion tools - Informatica, Spark, Hadoop, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform...
  - Data exploration and visualization tools - Excel, Tableau, Power BI,
  - AI, ML, and deep learning tools - Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, Azure ML, H2O

A couple of questions to debate with the class:

- **Is it better to master a few of the tools, or to be a beginner in many of them?**

  Once you know well one tool/language, it's much easier to learn a similar one. Some transitions are incredibly smooth and easy (MySQL -> SQL Server, Jupyter -> Google Colab), others require adapting to a new interface and some functionalities (Tableau -> Power BI), while a few of them do need quite a lot of practice (Python -> R, AWS -> GCP...). In tech, learning to learn is a key skill that we're going to practice A LOT here.

- **Which tools have more future? Is Python going to completely replace Excel?**

  We don't know. For 20 years it has been said that SQL is going to be replaced by other database technologies, yet it's still the most required skill in data jobs. We'd love to just learn the most advanced, sexiest tools and skip old-fashioned stuff like Excel. But the truth is that junior data positions usually focus a lot on these slightly less attractive tools, while skills like "Deep Learning" are, at most, a "nice to have". In some companies, you could be the one implementing the transition from Excel to Python (a tool with more potential for scalability, automation...), but you won't get that job if you don't know both tools.

### Prework Review - Data structures, conditional statements and iterations

> :clock10: 40 min

> Review the highlights below from the prework. All students should be familiar with these concepts so you can move quickly.
> This is an opportunity to identify students who are starting the class with a knowledge gap. Speak with your Program Manager if you identify a student in trouble.

<details>
<summary> Engagement Strategies </summary>

- Not necessary to cover all the prework problems; just pick a few where the students faced the most challenges.
- Ask them to work on the questions again and improve their solutions if they can.
- Encourage them to take help from you (and your TAs if you have any). Students should be 100% confident in the concepts covered in the prework by the end of the first week.
- Make the session more interactive by asking students to share their code and explain the solutions. This way, the teacher gets to know them better and faster.
- Play around with solutions, ask them to develop alternative solutions, change some parts of code, and ask the students if they can develop the logic around what's been changed.
- For highlighting keywords, preferably use the whiteboard instead of the editor if it is an in-person class.

Highlights:

- Data structures - list, dictionary, sets, tuple
- Iterations - `for` loop and `while` loop
- Conditional operators

#### Appendix

<details>
  <summary> Click for details:</summary>

- 1.1: Business level understanding. Give them an idea about the kind of data points that would be available (some examples of dummy features) and how they can use that information to answer business questions. Try to link it to “Skillset - Technical knowledge and sharp business acumen”. It is important to emphasize that it is a combination of. Developing a sound understanding of the business, your internal and external customers, and the company’s processes and the bottom line is extremely important.

- 1.2: Keep the introduction to a high level. For languages, you can talk about some of the reasons why Python and R are the most popular languages of choice for data analysts and data scientists. And then provide a high-level overview of the differences between python and R. Similarly for other tools and technologies that the students are not going to learn in the course, just provide a quick overview. We will not try to get into details of tools such as Power BI, Informatica, Spark, Hadoop, and AWS.

- 2.1: It is important to emphasize that data analysis is not only building complicated machine learning models but also business intelligence, creating simple visualizations, and writing simple/complex queries to answer business questions. And reporting/presentations is also an important task of data analysts.
