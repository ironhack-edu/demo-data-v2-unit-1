# Ironhack | Data Analytics - Unit 1

<br />

```diff
+ This is the Unit 1 of the Data Analytics v.2 curriculum materials.
```

### General description of the course

- It has 9 units (each unit represents one week in a full time cohort). Every week has 5 days in it from Monday to Friday.
  - Each day in the week has been divided into two halves (Half-A and Half-B). Hence there are 10 such halves in a week.
  - Each unit is comprised of 10 sub-units from 1 to 10.
  - Each sub-unit represents one half in a day (9:30AM to 1:00 PM)
  - Then there will be a break from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM.
  - Then next half will be from 2:00 PM to 5:30 PM
- In each half in a day, we have tried to keep three sessions each mostly.
- Three sessions are: two lectures of one hour each and one lab for one and a half hour
